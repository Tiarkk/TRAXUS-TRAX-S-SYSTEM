# TRAXUS TRAX-S SYSTEM 

A Discord bot designed to streamline onboarding for the unoffical traxus community server, with clean slash commands, dropdowns, and a review workflow for approvals. 
The code/repository is very far from perfect or even good. So please be gentle. However i am always eager to learn :)
---

## What It Does

- Users run `/traxus` to start the onboarding
- They pick a department, then a job from dropdown menus
- Once submitted, an application is posted to a review channel
- Approvers can approve or reject the request via buttons
  - If approved:
    - The applicant gets a DM
    - Their nickname is updated to:  
      `Display Name | TRAXUS Job Title`  
      (If itâ€™s too long, it falls back to just `TRAXUS Job Title`)
- Every step (request, approval, rejection) gets logged to a dedicated log channel
- If Name is to long after renaming shorten Name like
  - Exfiltration -> Exfil or Exf,
  - Manager -> Mgr,
  - Hygiene -> Hgn
  - If still to long just use `TRAXUS Job Title`


## Current Objectives

  - notify designated head/lead when someone applies in their divison or department
  - PostgreSQL support
  - Weboverlay to manage executives
